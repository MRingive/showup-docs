# Get Started

<Callout>
  The Show Up Club lives on the blockchain. So to get started you need a **Wallet** and some funds to use.
  If you don't know what any of this means, we suggest you [read our web3 section first](/web3/introduction).
</Callout>



The [Show Up Club](https://www.theshowup.club/) takes you through the following:

1) Create a journey
2) Invest in yourself
3) Show up every day

We'll cover each step below.

## 1) Create a Journey

[create-journey]: https://www.theshowup.club/create

To [create a journey][create-journey] you specify something you want to do
(like reading or running), a daily value (like 10 pages or 5 km), and a duration (e.g., 7 days).

This is your journey. Your goal. Make it something you truly want. 

## 2) Invest in Yourself

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The Show Up Club is in beta. Use at your own risk and only invest funds you are prepared to lose.
</Callout>

Now the interesting part. When you [create a journey][create-journey] you can decide to deposit MATIC
(the native token on the [Polygon network](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/network))
into the journey.

Your deposit will be held in the Show Up Club smart contract until your journey is over. If you complete your goal, you will be able 
to withdraw your deposit. But if you do not hit your goal, **you will lose what you have deposited. 😱**

E.g, if I decide to run 5 km every day for 10 days and I only log 49km by the end of the journey I will lose
what I have deposited.

Sounds crazy? 

We believe it sounds brilliant (with a hint of crazy 🤪).

The deposit is there to keep you accountable. [It is a commitment device.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device) 

If you believe in your journey (you should) it will be worth the risk.

Invest in yourself. The return-on-investment is insane 📈

*If you are not comfortable depositing anything that is completely fine. We don't judge. 
Just set the deposit to 0 when you create your journey.*

## 3) Show Up Every Day

Once you have created your journey you will see a chart that shows your progress.
[Something like this.](https://www.theshowup.club/journeys/1)

Of course your progress will show 0. 

And your job is now to show up every day. Go on the journey you have started and
track your progress along the way.

Everything you need should be on our journey page. You can enter your daily progress
and see it reflected in the chart next to your target. And when your journey is over
this is also where you can get your deposit back. If you have achieved your goal that is 😎.

You can also share your journey so people can follow your progress. Just use the URL of your
journey page. It is unique to your journey. It will look something like this: 
www.theshowup.club/journeys/1 (with a different number at the end).

And that's it. You are now prepared to go [start your own journey][create-journey]. 

Best of luck 🙏
